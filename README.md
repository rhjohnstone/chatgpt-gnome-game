# ChatGPT Gnome Game

This is a game written by ChatGPT in Python.

The first version sometimes had the coin be positioned off-screen, so I asked ChatGPT to fix that, and this is the final result.

Of course, I had to download the images myself, and ChatGPT forgot to import `numpy` at the top, so I fixed that myself.
